FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS: The above paper holds the real information. The code on this git repository is merely what we used to neetly shape the dataset for real analysis. If you wish to use the code to replicate our results, please follow the instructions below. I strongly reccomend reading the above paper as it will give context to the code.

1- In order to run the program, the dataset must be downloaded from : https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales

2- The CSV files must then be added to the data folder in src
